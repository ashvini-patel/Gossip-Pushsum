What works: Implemented faliure model controlled with parameter P (Propobility of an indicidual node failing)
for
Algo: Gossip,
Network: Full and Imperfect 2D Grid

Input: 

The input to run is provided as a command line with the following format:

./project2_bonus numNodes topology algorithm P

where numNodes is the number of actors involved
      topology is one of {line, full, 2D, imp2D}
      algorithm is only of {gossip}
      P can take any value from 1 to 100
      Note: Run project2_bonus and DO NOT add percentage symbol after P. 



Output:

the output indicates when the network is finished being built and the time taken for convergence of the gossip algorithm in milliseconds.



PLS Read bonus report for resons for implementing only Gossip and few networks.
